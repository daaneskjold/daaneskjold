		<article>Hi! My name is Marcelino Briseno
			<section>
			I am mexican. I have been living in Seattle for over a year now. I am 29 years old. I work as a SDET for a subcontracting company and my current client is Nordstrom. More specifically, I am working in the eCommerce web team, in an independent unit that does all the platform transitions to newer, cooler, better architecture / technologies.

				Most of my IT experience is as a .net developer. I like to think that am pretty decent at C#. But part of my current position involves interacting with a lot of design and front-end devs. And I noticed that I really, really like it! So, since I am still working and I would like some good foundations for this, I asked around and that is how I ended joining CodeFellows! I really hope to do the transition to full front end development side in the future! (during this or next year :P)

				On a side-uninteresting note. I'm not an IT graduate. My degree is in Mechanical Engineer. I like doing a lot of design and 3D modeling in that area. But the pay is not good. The hours are long. And I want to enjoy my life. And I have always loved programming. So that has me here, pretty much :) IT has given me the chance to do what I like, and enjoy what I do! It is not always great but so far, it has been an awesome ride!

				About the game. I am a huge basketball fan (and anime fan but that is other story). And I love the Miami Heat. The game takes you through a few paths depending on what you choose, and if you choose the path that will eventually lead you to my favorite team (the Miami Heat), on every layer you get an alert message with some encouraging -you are going through the right path- texts, that are different from all other paths which eventually show nothing. I think it adds a nice twist, because the actual game is not me guessing the team (which is pointless), is YOU going through the right flow.
				The bad thing? It has no replayability once you figured out the answer, which you can do immediatly just by looking at the code :P . Anyway! Just an example lol.
